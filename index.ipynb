This result aligns with the earlier statistical test, where we directly compared the click-through rates of the control and experimental groups using a two-sample proportion test, yielding a p-value of approximately 0.0088. In both tests, the p-values provide strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis. This suggests that the experimental homepage was more effective than the control group in terms of click-through rates. These results are statistically significant at conventional significance levels, indicating a substantial difference between the two groups."
